# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, which can help businesses optimize marketing strategies and customer targeting.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify distinct customer segments based on:
1. Annual Income
2. Spending Score

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **K-Means Clustering** (Scikit-learn)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Preprocessing**: StandardScaler for feature scaling

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Project
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Simulated retail dataset with `Annual Income` and `Spending Score` as features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler` for better clustering results.
3. **Clustering with K-Means**:
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
   - Applied K-Means to segment customers.
4. **Results Analysis**:
   - Visualized customer segments using scatter plots.
   - Analyzed segment characteristics for actionable insights.

## 📊 Results
The K-Means model successfully segmented customers into distinct clusters, providing insights into groups with:
- High spending scores and incomes
- Low spending scores and incomes

## 🚀 Visualizations
The project includes:
- **Elbow Method** plot to determine optimal clusters
- Scatter plots showing clustered data
